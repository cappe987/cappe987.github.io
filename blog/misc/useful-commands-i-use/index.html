I took a peek into my Zsh history and extracted just the commands (without any arguments). Below is the command I used. It also removes anything that starts with ., ~, and / to avoid local scripts and binaries. My original intent was to publish the whole list, but it’s long, and over half of it is just misspelled commands and a lot of aliases. And frankly, most of it is not very interesting. Instead, here is a curated selection just for you. I tried to include some lesser known commands/uses since other similar lists tend to have a huge overlap. I may revisit this post in the future to add more commands.\nhistory | sed -e 's/^[[:space:]]*//' | cut -d' ' -f3 | sed -e 's/^[\\.\\/~].*//g' | sort | uniq capmon I’m starting this list with a shameless plug of my command, and it only happened to be first due to alphabetical order ;). Run it with a command to check which Linux kernel capabilities the command requires. E.g. capmon \"tcpdump -i eth0\". As someone who loves and uses capabilities, this is very helpful. Check it out here.\nerrno Because I can never remember what the different exit codes mean I use a command to check it. Just errno -l is enough, but I prefer to reorder the output to make it easier to read:\nerrno -l | awk '{ printf(\"%s %s %s\\n\", $2, $1, substr($0,2)); }' cloc Count Lines Of Code does exactly what it says. Counts how many lines of code you have in different languages and how much of it is comments or blank lines, and displays it in a pretty table. Check it out here.\nrg Ripgrep is an awesome program for recursively searching directories for some text. It’s quite well known, but I had to include it here because it’s essential to me. Check it out here.\nfd Like Ripgrep, this is another incredibly useful utility tool for searching, but for files rather than inside files. It is an improved version of the standard Linux command find. Check it out here.\ndelta A modern diff viewer with a pretty output and syntax highlighting. I use this as the pager for git diff. Check it out here.\nnautilus This is the standard file explorer for Ubuntu and probably many more distros. If you would like to open a directory with the file explorer from the terminal (rather than navigating to it via the GUI) you can run this command with the desired path. E.g. nautilus . to open the current directory.\npython Now this may look stupid, but I wanted to list it here because whenever I need a calculator I open a terminal and start the REPL. Even though I rarely write actual Python code.\nrofi A pretty alternative to dmenu for creating interactive and searchable lists and selecting an item. Check it out here.\nreuse Reuse is an initiative by the Free Software Foundation to standardize how code licenses are indicated in projects and source files. Along with it exists the command of the same name. My mostly used is reuse lint to check if my project is compliant.\nrifle This command comes along when you install the ranger command (a TUI file explorer). It opens a file with the correct (as good as it can) program. There already exists a program called xdg-open that does this, and which is included on most distros. But I find rifle to be much better at picking the right application.\ntac tac is the reverse of cat. And that’s just what it does. Any input to cat is just spat out the same way it came in. tac reverses the order of the lines. I often use this inside Vim by selecting some lines, then running it from Vim with :!tac. (Note: placing an exclamation mark at the start of a Vim command runs it as a shell command).\nAdded 2024-03-15:\nbtop A better and prettier alternative to the more common htop. Check it out here.\nunshare Preferably with the arguments -n -r to start a separate network namespace and as root. This allows running commands as root even though you might not have root access. Certain actions are obviously not possible even as this root. But it can allow you to do testing of applications that requires root. For me it’s relevant for network applications.\n","wordCount":"745","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-31T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-31T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://casan.se/blog/misc/useful-commands-i-use/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Casper Andersson","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://casan.se/favicon.svg"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://casan.se/ accesskey=h title="Casper Andersson (Alt + H)">Casper Andersson</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://casan.se/blog title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://casan.se/docs title=Docs><span>Docs</span></a></li><li><a href=https://casan.se/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://casan.se/about/ title="About Me"><span>About Me</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://casan.se/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://casan.se/blog/>Blog</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://casan.se/blog/misc/>Misc</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Useful commands I use</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 31, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min</div><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://casan.se/tags/misc/>Misc</a></li><li><a href=https://casan.se/tags/linux/>Linux</a></li></ul></header><div class=post-content><p>I thought it would be fun to look at all the different commands I use.
