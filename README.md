# Personal Website

My personal website, based on the theme [Jekyll Clean Dark](https://github.com/streetturtle/jekyll-clean-dark).

Run it using 
```sh
./run.sh
```
or if you want faster rebuilds do
```sh
./run.sh --incremental
```

Sometimes after having used incremental and needing to do a full rebuild you need to do a clean before doing full rebuild
```sh
bundle exec jekyll clean
./run.sh
```
