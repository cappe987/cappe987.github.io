It is a simple way to quickly create a commit with a short explanation. My issue with it is that it teaches you to write short commit messages. You only fit so much in the terminal before it starts wrapping around and getting hard to work with, and you can&amp;rsquo;t do any proper formatting.</description></item><item><title>Jekyll markdown lists that don't start on 1.</title><link>https://casan.se/blog/jekyll-markdown-lists-that-dont-start-on-1./</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casan.se/blog/jekyll-markdown-lists-that-dont-start-on-1./</guid><description>This is just a short note to myself and anyone who encounters the same issue. While writing a post recently I wanted a numbered list that started with a number other than 1. Frustratingly, Jekyll does not support this. Jekyll always start lists with 1. I found this very inconvenient and tried to find a way around it.</description></item></channel></rss>
