      <h1>What are they?</h1>
      <p>
        Type checking can differ a lot in modern programming languages.
        This post may contain personal opinions as I am personally 
        a big fan of static type checking. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Static type checking can be defined as language where the 
        compiler checks the types. Type safety, to a certain degree, 
        can be guaranteed without even running the program. A variable has 
        one type and one type only. It can never change its type. This eliminates 
        a lot of errors and you can spend less time testing it.   
      </p>
      <p>
        A language with dynamic type checking has its types checked during runtime. 
        This adds extra overhead when running, and the possibility of a runtime type 
        error. Since it only checks the types it encounter it won't validate the types 
        of any execution paths you don't test. 
      </p>
        
      <p>
        In the Python code snippet below there are two separate execution paths, 
        and depending on the what value <code class="inline">some_condition</code> holds
        the else condition may or may not run. 
        
        
      </p>
<pre class="code-block"><code class="python">
  if some_condition:
    print(1 + 1)
  else:
    print(1 + "1")
</code></pre>
      <p>
        Someone who has used Python may see that
        the print-statement in the else path will give a type error. 
        In a statically 
        type checked language the error could be caught compile-time. Python, 
        however, has a dynamic type system and will not notice the type error if 
        execution doesn't go down that path. Now picture the condition being 
        something that evaluates to <code class="inline">True</code> 99% of the time.
        The error may not be caught until you force a test on it.

        Mixed languages, inheritance downcasting requires dynamic.
