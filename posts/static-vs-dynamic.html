      <h1>What are they?</h1>
      <p>
        Type checking can differ a lot in modern programming languages.
        This post may contain personal opinions as I am personally 
        a big fan of static type checking.

      <p>
        Static type checking can be defined as language where the 
        compiler checks the types. Type safety, to a certain degree, 
        can be guaranteed without even running the program. A variable has 
        one type and one type only. It can never change its type. This eliminates 
        a lot of errors and you can spend less time testing it.   
      </p>
      <p>
        A language with dynamic type checking has its types checked during runtime. 
        This adds extra overhead when running, and the possibility of a runtime type 
        error. Since it only checks the types it encounter it won't validate the types 
        of any execution paths you don't test.

        Mixed languages, inheritance downcasting requires dynamic.
