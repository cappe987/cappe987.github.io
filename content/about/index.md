My name is Casper Andersson and I currently work as a software developer. I
enjoy most types of non-UI programming. I am absolutely trash at doing pretty
user interfaces and prefer my programs to stay within the terminal. Due to my
job my interests currently lie in C programming and computer networks. On top
of programming I also really like to write technical blogposts and
documentation.

On top of my studies I also worked as an assistant in a course on <i>Introduction
to Programming</i> in C a couple times. The tasks included helping students with
their assignments and answer any questions they had regarding programming and
the course.
