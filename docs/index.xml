This is useful for measuring the impact of traffic congestion and testing QoS features. The timestamped packets are intended to never touch any software on their trip through the network since that adds considerable delay and jitter, and the benefit of hardware timestamping dwindles.</description></item><item><title>Hexend</title><link>https://casan.se/docs/hexend/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casan.se/docs/hexend/</guid><description>Send hexdumps copied from Tcpdump/Wireshark. Save the hexdump in a file and give it to hexend to send it on an interface. Useful for repeating a specific captured frame, instead of making a pcap playback or trying to recreate it using tools like Nemesis or EasyFrames. It is also possible to write the frame by hand if you so wish.</description></item><item><title>Capmon</title><link>https://casan.se/docs/capmon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casan.se/docs/capmon/</guid><description>Monitor when processes check capabilities(7) to find out what they require. Run capmon &amp;lt;cmd&amp;gt; to track the capabilities it requires. It&amp;rsquo;s important to not run it with sudo since that bypasses certain checks. Let the command fail at the first missing capability check and add that capability, then try again and see if if fails on more.</description></item></channel></rss>
