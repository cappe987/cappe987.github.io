# About me

My name is Casper Andersson and I'm a software developer. I graduated with a
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in June 2021. I write about various
computer topics that I encounter at work or during my free time. I currently
work with development in the computer network industry, and as a result I write
a lot about that here.
